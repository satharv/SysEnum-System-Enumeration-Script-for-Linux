# SysEnum-System-Enumeration-Script-for-Linux
This script automates the collection of system information on a Linux machine, running a series of commands to gather details about the system's configuration, environment, and network settings. The results are saved in a sys_enum.txt file, with separate logging of the command execution in a sys_enum.log file.
